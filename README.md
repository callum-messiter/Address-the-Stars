# Address-the-Stars

what3words have divided the Earth's surface into 57 trillion 3m-by-3m squares, and assigned each with a unique 3-word identifier
(table.lamp.spoon, for example). 

I took some inspiration from their idea and added three-word identifiers to a stellar catalogue. Now 87,475 stars from the <a href="https://github.com/astronexus/HYG-Database">HYG Database</a> each have a three-word address.
